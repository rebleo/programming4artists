#### Course Requirements:
Students are expected to participate in class: contributing positively to discussions, arriving on time having thoughtfully completed the reading, technical and creative assignments. Computers and mobile devices must be silenced and not glowing during critique, class discussion and student presentations.

You are required to maintain a blog for this class. This is where you will post your homework assignments to then link to our class wiki. Think of it like a digital sketchbook - the blog is not meant to be a finished portfolio site, but a place for your creative process and works in progress.

##### Mobile Devices
Your device is required for the course. Make it a tool for you to use in this class, and not a device that directs your attention away from you and your classmates’ class time. It’s okay if you do not have a mobile device.

#### Reading
There will be a reading every week. There are 2 required texts: [Ways of Seeing by John Berger](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/56465/ways-of-seeing/) and [Mindstorms by Seymour Papert](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746). Any other readings will be linked by week as we go along in the semester.

#### Assignments:
Every week students will be asked to read, watch and share a variety of media experiences as well as share the work they create during in class discussion and critique. Homework should be posted weekly to the [class wiki](https://github.com/rebleo/programming4artists/wiki)
